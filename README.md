# The effect of atmospheric drag uncertainty on orbital elements

Uses sgp4 to investigate how errors in B^* = \rho_0 A C_d/2m  affect position uncertainty. It doesn't matter if the uncertainty in the area-to-mass ratio, the drag coefficient, or the atmospheric density. They all have the same effect.

Thermospheric density uncertainty is anywhere between 5% and
